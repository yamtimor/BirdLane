# BirdLane

> *A jazz-inspired Kotlin DSL for composing expressive data pipelines.*

BirdLane is not just another ETL tool. It’s a musical instrument for developers — a Kotlin-based DSL where each pipeline is a **chart**, each step a **phrase**, and the execution engine your **band**.

No YAML. No rigid DAGs. Just flow.
