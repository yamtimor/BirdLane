# BirdLane Philosophy

BirdLane is not a DAG engine.

It’s not a collection of task configs or scheduled YAML.

It’s a language — inspired by jazz — that lets pipelines groove, not grind.

BirdLane treats orchestration like music: with phrasing, intent, and flow.  
In classical systems, each task has its own rigid score — isolated and over-scripted.  
In jazz, everyone reads from the same chart.  
That’s BirdLane.  
The `.chart` file is the shared lead sheet — one structure, interpreted by many parts.

The system is split between composers (the DSL) and players (the Executor).  
Each step is a phrase. The pipeline is the tune. You decide how to play it.

This project is not a tool.  
It’s a movement toward beautiful developer expression in data.
